- Why did you ... ?

    To put all of my bookmarks and files (which I don't care to make public) in one place. I can also quickly reference this site to anyone who asks me for source of XYZ.

- How did you ... ?

    [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) + [Material Theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) ; hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

- What IDE / tools did you use ?

    [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + Markdown AIO (*search: yzhang.markdown-all-in-one*) + sometimes [Typora](https://typora.io/)

- Can I also add my links ?

    Yes, you can! Every page has an edit icon in the upper right corner. But please; think about where and what you want to add. 

- I've found a broken link

    Please use the edit button to delete or change the link to a working one.

- I have a question about XYZ
