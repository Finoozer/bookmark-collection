### Glossary

The link descriptions sometimes use abbreviations, jargon or technical terminology (aka *techspeak*). Hovering over a dotted word reveals the full word of an acronym, for jargon and techspeak see [Glossary](glossary.md)

### Icons

Some of the links on FBC can fall into multiple categories. That's where icons come in. Icons specify all related topics of a link. Table below shows what each icon represents

|                        Icon                         | Description                            |

|               :material-drama-masks:                | Privacy                                |

### Emphasis, sources and other notes

 - Link descriptions that are in *italics* are copied descriptions from either the official website or wiki
 - Glossary uses a lot of external sources, thus provides links to original websites through upper index numbers
 - I try to avoid short-links (i.e. `bit.ly/xyz`)
 - This is a curated collection of links, but I still can't say with guarantee that all of the links are safe; don't open the links if you don't know how to protect yourself from adversaries 

### I have a question

 - See [FAQ](faq.md)
