### Icons

Links may have icons indicating some sort of undesired property. Color of these icons usually represents severity of the issue (viz table bellow). Hovering over these icons will bring up a pop-up with an explanation. I.e. :material-alert:{ .yellow title="Heavy freemium model. Not many features available in the free tier."}.

| Icon color | Severity  |
| ---------- | --------- |
| Red        | Very high |
| Orange     | High      |
| Yellow     | Medium    |
| Green      | Low       |

### Emphasis, sources and other notes

- Link descriptions that are in _italics_ are copied descriptions from either the official website or wiki
- Glossary uses a lot of external sources, thus provides links to original websites through upper index numbers
- I try to avoid short-links (i.e. `bit.ly/xyz`)
- This is a curated collection of links, but I still can't say with guarantee that all of the links are safe; don't open the links if you don't know how to protect yourself from adversaries

### I have a question

- See [FAQ](faq.md)
