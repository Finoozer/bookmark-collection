# Coding

List of language-independent practice websites and inspirations.

Editor notes: 

-   Libraries, packages, modules are colloquially named "Libraries"
-   Every language page must be structured Docs, Tools, Libraries (Other; if applicable)

## Practice

-   [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/)

    Let's you solve problems with code. Ranking system and social hub implemented. IMHO the best site to learn new languages.

-   [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)

    Geared more towards common technical interview questions and expanding knowledge level.

## Inspiration

-   [Clone Wars](https://gourav.io/clone-wars)

    100+ open-source clones and alternatives of popular sites like Airbnb, Amazon, Instagram, Netflix, Tiktok, Spotify, Whatsapp, Youtube, etc.
